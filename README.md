## General Information
### Project Information
The project is a data science project assignment that uses the train.csv data set to model predicting the price of a house with the available independent variables. It will be used by the company to o predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
Also, determining the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

### Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

#### Business Goal:
Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.

This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

In this we are using csv dataset:-
- **train.csv**

Column descriptions are provided in:-
